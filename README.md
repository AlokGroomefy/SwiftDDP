## Status
SwiftDDP isn't ready for prime time yet. The basic functions work, but it's missing features and the api isn't final.

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

SwiftDDP is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftDDP"
```
